# Linux Architecture (Easy)

User
 ->
Shell (Terminal)
 ->
Kernel (Brain of Linux)
 ->
Hardware

    •	Kernel → Talks to hardware
	•	Shell → Where we type commands
	•	Terminal → Black screen

# Linux File System Structure

Everything starts from / (root)

| Directory  | Use                 |
|----------- |-------------------- |
| /          | Root                |
| /home      | User folders        |
| /etc       | Configuration files |
| /bin       | Basic commands      |
| /usr       | User software       |
